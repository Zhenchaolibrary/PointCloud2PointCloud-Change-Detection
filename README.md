# Detecting Building Changes between Two Point Clouds using Patch-based CNN

This project aims at detecting building changes between two airborne point clouds which were obtained from two epochs. The results are patch-based change masks.

The code was written in Jupyter Notebook with PyTorch framework. It contains the following architectures: FF-HH, FF-HHC, FF-DC, PSI-HH, PSI-HHC, and PSI-DC. You may adjust the hyper-parameters or network configurations for your own data. Check the referred paper below for more details.
